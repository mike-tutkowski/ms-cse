Sample API invocations:

Note: Query-parameter keys are case sensitive. If you do not use the proper casing, the key is not recognized. If it is a required key,
then the API call will fail. If it is not a required key, then the parameter is silently ignored. This is due to the way Java Spring Boot
handles these kinds of parameters. There are workarounds that I could have put in place, but there is also a fair amount of debate about
whether or not ignoring the case of a key might be considered a weakening of the API "contract." As such, I have simply left the Spring
Boot handling of these parameters are is.
